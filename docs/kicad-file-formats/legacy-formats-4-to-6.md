# Legacy Formats (KiCad 4.0 up to 6.0)

Source: https://dev-docs.kicad.org/en/file-formats/legacy-4-to-6/index.html

## Overview

This page documents the legacy file formats used in KiCad versions 4.0 through 6.0.

## Key Information

Older documentation for the non-s-expression schematic file format and older printed circuit board s-expression format is available via a PDF reference to legacy documentation (`legacy_file_format_documentation.pdf`).

## Important Notice

**The old printed circuit board file format document is not up to date and should not be used as a reference.**

## Context

This page serves as a navigation point within KiCad's broader file format documentation, which covers multiple format types including S-Expression formats for footprints, boards, symbols, schematics, and worksheets, plus legacy PCB formats predating version 4.0.
